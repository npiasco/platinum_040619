\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
	Summary:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 2-step pose estimation method, from coarse to find localization,
		\item use of the relative geometric information learned by CNN from raw RGB images to recover the real pose of the query,
		\item unlike learned approaches, the proposed method can be used in completely unknown environments.
	\end{itemize}

	For future works we want to find a common optimization framework to train each of the computer vision task involved in the pose refinement process.
